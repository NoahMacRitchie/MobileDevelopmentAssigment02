NOTE: We weren't sure if the warning for HyperTensive Blood Pressure was supposed to come up
when the user types into an edittext, or when they actually add the reading. So to test the 
HyperTensive Blood Pressure warning, press the enter key on the Android keyboard after typing the Hypertensive
value in.
